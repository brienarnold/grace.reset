Title: Fun Quilter Ruler Base

An Essential Sewing Accessory for Stitching Quilts

When quilters are working on quilting projects, a variety of helpful accessories are required to make the task simpler. A fun quilter ruler base is an essential accessory for a long arm sewing machine to assist with designing and stitching wall hangings and quilts without making errors due to large templates falling off of small surfaces. The Grace Company offers a quality line of quilting equipment especially made to assist with stitching large pieces of layered fabric that are necessary for making quilts for huge mattress sizes. The Q’nique Quilter online retailer located in Salt Lake City offers a line of equipment that includes a fun quilter ruler base that many commercial and hobbyist quilters want to own to attach to a long arm sewing machine. 

Ruler Bases are designed to Attach Quickly to Sewing Machines

Many novice or experienced quilters use measuring devices such as straight rulers or shaped templates to create intricate stitching designs on fabrics with a long arm quilting machine placed on a specialized frame. Templates and straight rulers do not rest properly on a regular long arm sewing machine, leading to the development of a fun quilter ruler base accessory by engineers with an understanding of sewing. The specifications of this long arm sewing machine accessory include feature such as: 

• Clear acrylic – making it easy to view objects underneath the base
• Thick plastic – allowing heavy fabrics to remain in place while stitching
• Four sturdy magnets – designed for quick attachment to the sewing machine
• Versatile – also usable for left-handed sewers

Helps with Creating Intricate Stitching Designs

A fun quilter ruler base is attached near the long arm sewing machine’s hopping foot to provide a larger surface to hold a sewer’s specialized templates or straight rulers. Many quilters need these devices to create beautiful straight and curved stitching lines on quilts. Creating intricate designs on quilt tops requires stitching slowly and carefully while using a fun quilter ruler base along with templates and straight rulers. For commercial quilt makers, stitching correctly is essential to have a product that is perfect to sell to customers. Hobbyists also want to make gorgeous designs on wall hangings and quilts without the frustration of needing to remove inaccurate stitches from fabrics. 

Ruler Bases Permit Using Many Types of Templates

Quilt makers using bases on machines learn to avoid hitting the hard plastic to prevent breaking stitching needles. A quality base on a long arm sewing machine permits quilters to use a variety of templates and straight rulers, including:
