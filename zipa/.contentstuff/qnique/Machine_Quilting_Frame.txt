Title: Machine Quilting Frame

The Importance of Having Specialized Equipment for Sewing Quilts

A machine quilting frame is an essential piece of equipment for hobbyists or commercial sewers making patchwork, pieced or embroidery embellished quilts designed as coverlets for beds. Large sections of cotton or wool fabrics are difficult to maneuver on traditional sewing machines with small work areas. Fortunately, manufacturers have worked with knowledgeable quilters to develop a machine quilting frame that is commonly known as a long arm that allows stretching fabrics with clasps along the devices to hold it firmly in place. Anyone stitching the layers of a quilt together or creating embroidery stitches needs the ability of seeing the entire item with this specialized device. 

Vital Features to Look for When Buying Quilt Frames for Home or Commercial Use

At the same time, the machine quilting frame must hold the fabric tautly to permit accurate stitching to create the most beautiful design without errors. A manufacturer of devices meant for making quilts must also have several models to choose from in different price points to meet the needs of commercial or home sewers. Some of the features that shoppers look for when buying a machine quilting frame are: 
<ul>
<li>Sturdy rolling bars – to hold fabrics in place in different sections</li>
<li>Surface is appropriate size – to hold a sewing machine</li>
<li>Smooth carriage system – to provide great stitching</li>
<li>Having several rails or rollers – enough to hold fabric off the floor</li>
<li>Type of material – traditional wood, heavy steel or lightweight aluminum</li>
<li>Adjustable height – height adjusts with legs for sitting or standing work</li>

How to Find Well Made Quilt Frames at an Online Store 

In addition to the above features, many quilters want the ability to baste several fabrics together before placing the layers of materials on a machine quilting frame while others want to stitch without this step. The ability to place the quilt quickly in the frame makes it possible to begin sewing items right away, leading to saving time for everyone and increasing profits for commercial sewers. All of the mechanisms on the machines require testing by manufacturers to ensure the components do not harm fabrics by making holes or discolorations. In addition, the machines should have safety covers in place over moving components to avoid injuries to the hands or fingers. A good way for quilters to find quality frames for sewing is to look at an online retailer that provides full color photographs and detailed descriptions of products.
